         ii. Utilized the text function to create a month column and obtain month-wise data: "TEXT(G2, "mmm")".

3) Data Analysis:

         ii. Created a horizontal bar chart to visually represent the top five states with the highest sales.
        iii. Created a pie chart to examine the distribution of shopping percentages between men and women.
         iv. Created a Pie Chart to gain insights into the order status of customers.â€™
          v. Created a Pie Chart to analyze the proportion of each distribution channel.
         vi. Created a Column Chart to examine the purchasing patterns across different age groups for both men and women.
